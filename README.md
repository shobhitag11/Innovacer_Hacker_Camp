# Innovacer_Hacker_Camp
This is a Prototype of my idea related to the Innovacer's Hacer Camp Challenge.

This is a simple demo to track employees and measure their focus, attention, real-time efficiency and lot more… 
Aim of this idea is that user’s working activities  doesn’t impact their heath as well as performance and can keep employer and employees posted. So that the best solutions & recommendations may be provided on time to employee.
I have attached the screenshots to show how the complete idea works..
