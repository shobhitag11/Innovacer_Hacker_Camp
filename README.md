# Innovacer_Hacker_Camp
This is a Prototype of my idea related to the Innovacer's Hacer Camp Challenge.

This is a simple demo to track employees and measure their focus, attention, real-time efficiency, and a lot more… Aim of this idea is that users’ working activities don’t impact their health as well as performance and can keep employer and employees posted. So that the best solutions & recommendations may be provided on time to employees. I have attached the screenshots to show how the complete idea works.

Please check the PDF Shobhit_Agarwal_Incedo.pdf where I have included and defined the complete overview of the product.

I've attached the GUI screenshot's and the output results for facial recognition, yawning detection, attentiveness system, which is also helpful in detecting eye blinking.
